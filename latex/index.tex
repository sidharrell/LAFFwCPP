I am engaged in the course \href{https://www.edx.org/course/utaustinx/utaustinx-ut-5-01x-linear-algebra-1162#.U9VoynWx3UY}{\tt https\-://www.\-edx.\-org/course/utaustinx/utaustinx-\/ut-\/5-\/01x-\/linear-\/algebra-\/1162\#.\-U9\-Voyn\-Wx3\-U\-Y} and would like to follow along with the course material rewriting the algorithms into C++ code. I'm not a big fan of Python based on my experience with Python based applications running on Ubuntu. And I wanted to stay with a O\-O\-P based language. I initially started in P\-H\-P, but switched to C++ for performance and portability. If I still want to output a webpage with a json stream of the data to the browser for rendering visually in javascript, I can still call the C++ library through a native executable interface in P\-H\-P. I thought this overall system would spread the processing load between the server and the client.
